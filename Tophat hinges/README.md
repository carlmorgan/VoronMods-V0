This is version of my hinges to retro fit the hinges w/o reprinting the rear part of ther top hat

- change the M3x8mm bottom hinge screws for M3x10mm.
- the hinge itself uses M3x12
- drill 3.5mm hole for an heat insert for the top hinge or use self taping M3x10mm (drill 2-2.5mm for self taping M3).
- all new tophat lower corrners use same screws.

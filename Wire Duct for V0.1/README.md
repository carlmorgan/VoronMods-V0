Wire Duct for V0.1.

I'm not sure if this printed wire duct makes sense, it is hard to print and if you print it horizontal, the fins my break afterwards.
If printed Vertical, you need supports which is another problem.
Maybe I'll invest sometime time to design easy 3D printable wire duct.

It is 16Â mm long, you can cut few centimeters in slicer to make it fit V0.1 build plate if you printing it on Voron V0.

It is made specific to align the cutouts with the SKR E3 V2 connectors.

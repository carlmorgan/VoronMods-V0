2nd X MGN7 rail for the mini AB.

A/B mounts are from my LGX mount design.

Y end stop need to relocated, for that I designed new Z end stop.

You need to print new X carriage, backplate and A/B stepper mounts.

Maybe it is possible w/o reprinting the X carriage, drill 2 holes, insert heat insert could be enough, but as you need to take off the belts, why not reprint the carriage.
